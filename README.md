# What is it about?

This racing game is going to be a game that can be played by four 
people on one screen. This has the function of dividing the screen 
into 4 so that each person has a vision of it where each player 
has to give everything to get from 1 to the goal and be the winner

# what did I do

# why I made the game?

I created this game to learn how to create a racing game because 
it helped me understand how to create it so I could create my own soon. 
This game taught me a lot how to use the engine well, the inputs so 
that it works on any platform, the turns, skids and much more

# briefly explain the game?

It's a running game where each player has to do their best to stay in first place. Make the turns and skids very well to be able to beat all the players, it has a function of being able to split the template into 4 so that four people can play locally on the same screen
